# chrome-usage-data-analysis

**Overview**
This project involves analyzing Chrome application usage data to uncover insights into user behavior and interaction patterns. The dataset includes various metrics such as usage, notifications, and times opened, which provide valuable information for understanding user engagement with the Chrome browser.

**Steps Involved**

**Data Acquisition:**
Utilized Pandas library in Python to read the dataset from a CSV file.
Initial examination of the data using the head() function to understand its structure.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Checked for missing values using the isnull().sum() function to ensure data integrity.
Descriptive statistics were computed using the describe() function to gain insights into the distribution of numeric variables.

**Data Visualization:**
Utilized Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects to create dynamic visualizations.
Generated bar charts to visualize trends in Chrome usage metrics (e.g., usage, notifications, times opened) over time and across different applications.
Constructed a scatter plot to explore the relationship between the number of notifications and the amount of usage.

**Insights and Interpretation:**
Derived insights from the visualizations regarding user behavior and engagement patterns.
Explored peak usage periods, the impact of notifications on user activity, and other significant trends.
